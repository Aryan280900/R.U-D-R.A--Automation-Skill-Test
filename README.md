# ðŸ“Œ News Article Categorization and Assignment System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Python program **retrieves 100 news articles** from various sources and **intelligently assigns** them to user personas based on their **topics of interest**. It uses **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to analyze the articles and ensure **at least 5 relevant articles** are assigned to each persona.

## âœ… Key Features

### ðŸ”¹ Fetches 100 Random News Articles
- Uses the **NewsAPI** to get 100 diverse news articles **without category restrictions**.
- Articles are retrieved using a **wildcard search** (`q="*"`), ensuring a wide variety of topics.

### ðŸ”¹ Understands User Interests with NLP
- Each **persona has predefined interests** (e.g., AI, sports, entertainment).
- The program **extracts keywords** from article titles and descriptions using **SpaCy** (NLP).

### ðŸ”¹ Intelligent Article Assignment
- Compares extracted **keywords from articles** with **each personaâ€™s interests**.
- **Scores each article** based on how many keywords match the personaâ€™s interests.
- Articles are **sorted by relevance**, ensuring the best matches are assigned.

### ðŸ”¹ Guarantees Minimum 5 Articles per Persona
- Each persona gets **at least 5 relevant articles**, if possible.
- If more than 5 articles are available, **higher-scoring articles are prioritized**.

### ðŸ”¹ Well-Structured Output
- Prints **personalized news feeds** for each user in the format:
  ```

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack

- **Python**
- **Requests** (for API calls)
- **SpaCy** (for NLP-based keyword extraction)
- **Random** (for shuffling articles)
- **Collections (defaultdict)** (for efficient data storage)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters?

âœ” Helps **filter out irrelevant news** and **deliver personalized content**.  
âœ” Saves **time and effort** by automatically categorizing news.  
âœ” Uses **AI and NLP** to **intelligently analyze** and **match news** to users.  
âœ” Can be **scaled** to handle **more personas and topics**.

## ðŸš€ Possible Enhancements

- **Store the results in a JSON file** instead of printing.
- **Email the curated news feed** to each user.
- **Improve keyword extraction** using **advanced NLP techniques** (e.g., Named Entity Recognition).
